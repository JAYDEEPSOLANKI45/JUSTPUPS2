            <ul> JUSTPUPS believes everything’s pawsible!</ul>

            <ul>And we are working round the clock to make sure no pet or pet parent ever has a ruff
                day!</ul> 
            
            <ul>Founded in 2011 by Poorvi and Ashish Anthony, the diverse pet care retail chain
                has spread its wings. In a decade, we have grown to more than 42 stores in 16 cities
                across India, and a customer base of over two million happy pet parents – and happier
                tail-waggers.</ul> 
            
            <ul>Our idea is to provide products and services that aid in a long, happy, and healthy life
                for your fur baby. Our range of choices – food, toys, accessories, training, and grooming – help meet all the lifetime needs of your pets.</ul> 
            
            <ul>We put pets first because they always, always put us first. And it’s why we continue to
                doggedly champion those who change our life with unconditional love.</ul> 
            
            <ul>Our stores – online and offline – are a reflection of that.</ul> 
            
            <ul>With a massive product catalogue that takes care of your pet’s needs – whether you are
                thinking of turning pet parent, have already bought an adorable mutt home, or are
                looking for advice and connections, we provide it all. Woof, woof!</ul> 
            
            <ul>All furballs and floofies are welcome at our offline stores – even squishy ones – and shopping here becomes an excursion of sorts for pets and their ‘hoomans’. Be it a trip to buy a treat or toy, a grooming service, or checking in with an expert, a trip to JUSTDOGS is more than just an errand. It lets pet parents show their love and affection for their furry friends.</ul> 
            
            <ul>We have a deep and paw-ssionate understanding of furballs of all kinds, and we have only one objective: to be fiercely loyal to your pet.
            </ul> 
            <ul>JUSTPUPS is the largest specialty retailer of services and solutions for the lifetime needs
                of every pet. But we don’t want to be just that. We are working hard to be the go-to-
                confidante that champions this journey of unconditional love end-to-end.
                </ul>
            <ul>We know that we’re fur-tunate to have these adorable pets in our life, and are working
                to do more, be more.
                
                JUSTPUPS isn’t simply a provider of premium pet care products and services. We are a
                community of animal lovers, a brand that encourages a better understanding our furry
                Friends, and aims to make their world a healthier, happier one.
                
                Together, let’s raise the woof!</ul></div>
